About 30 years, it's a nice round number. C'mon, c'mon let's go. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. Maybe you were adopted. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. What's the meaning of this. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. No, I refuse to except the responsibility. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?
