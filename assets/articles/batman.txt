I'm Batman

My anger outweights my guilt.

Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages.

Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended.

It was a dog. It was a big dog.

No guns, no killing.

Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.

I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham.
