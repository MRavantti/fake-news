So you came back to die with your city! I'm Gotham's reckoning. It'll end the ball of damns you've all been living on. A necessary evil. It will be extremely painful... for you Every man who has lotted here over the centuries, has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy, so simple! And like shipwrecked men turning to seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. And then here there can be no true despair without hope. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe that they can survive so that you can watch them climbing over each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture an entire city. And then when you've truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And then, when that is done, and Gotham is... ashes Then you have my permission to die. Peace has cost you your strength. Victory has defeated you. I am the League of Shadows. Citizens, take control. Take control of your city! Your Punishment Must Be More Severe. It doesn't matter who we are. What matters is our plan.	Behind you, stands a symbol of oppression. Blackgate Prison, where a thousand men have languished under the name of this man: Harvey Dent. Ah yes! I was wondering what would weight first. Your spirit... or your body? Do you feel in charge? You fight like a younger man, there's nothing held back. It's admirable, but mistaken. Speak of the devil, and he shall appear.
